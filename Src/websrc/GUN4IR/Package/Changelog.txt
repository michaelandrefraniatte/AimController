*2021/02/20 - FW2.64

Firmware:
- Fixed a bug that kept the controller axises in upper left position
- Fixed a bug that prevented the modes to switch correctly

*2021/02/07 - GUI 1.26beta - FW2.62

In this update I mainly modified the way the offscreen reload and screen content mode work.

Previously, you could only switch between full screen or 4:3, but now you can switch between fullscreen and a user defined aspect ratio. You can change this aspect ratio either from the GUI (to save in eeprom) or from a serial command (for per game setup). Everything on that new mode is written in the guide and the GUI.

Now when offscreen is in "Disabled", you can't fire offscreen (other buttons still work offscreen of course), and a 4th mode "Normal Shot" was added if you want to be able to shot offscreen without reloading.

User Guide:
- Corrected and modified various data
- Added all the previously undocumented serial commands, now you can modify most of the gun aspects through serial

GUI:
- updated to support the new modes

Firmware:
- updated to support the new modes
- fixed the gamepad buttons issue
- removed the gamepad mode dpad to save space (dpad now works as normal buttons, allowing to use it for something else)
- fixed an issue when changing modes through combo would keep some buttons hold
- better combo button switching, now just pushing the mode+button combo should always switch to the correct mode, no need to do them in a specific order
- slightly increased the mode button and trigger button debounce (20ms)

- RN-42 (or hacked HC-05) bluetooth board support! Now you can use bluetooth and usb at the same time.
  To make it work, configure the module to hid controller, then connect it to the pin 0 and 1 of the board (more info about that coming soon).

*2020/10/08 - GUI 0.991beta - FW 2.33
GUI:
- Updated the GUI graphic management. Now both camera sensor tab and full screen test mode should be super smooth, no more flickering! So you should be able to see way more easily if there are any detection issue with your LEDs.
- Finally added the temperature sensor reading button, now you can check the solenoid current temperature with a single button press.
- added a function to change sensitivity for the camera sensor in real time; press CTRL keyboard key in the camera test mode to change the sensitivity level. (don't forget to upload the settings once you finish, if you are happy with the result)
- fixed a small bug that was preventing the sensitivity to display correctly

Firmware:
- added real time sensitivity change for the new GUI function
- fixed some bugs that were preventing the gamepad mode from working correctly

- various bug fixes and optimizations


*2020/10/05 - GUI v0.97beta - Firmware 2.30 Anniversary edition
Firmware - for the 1 year anniversary of this firmware, I wanted to do a big update on it, so here are the updates so far (more incoming);
- Rewrote all libraries and code to take less space and have less global latency (down to ~4ms total processing time)
- Fixed various bugs that was causing issues to the calibration and the accuracy
- Improved a lot the global precision, especially on the sides of the screen or when moving around
- Added a "sync mode" that waits for the position to be calculated before activating the pressed buttons, instead of pressing them right away. It allows to get perfect accuracy on fast motion with a very small latency tradeoff. I recommend to leave it on.
- Changed the calibration to 5 steps (instead of the usual 3). Since the calibration has to be done only once, I decided to change it to make it way more accurate and failproof. Note that each step will only be validated if the camera sees the necessary IR points (4 for center, 3 for each side).
- Prepared the firmware for the next updates.
GUI:
- small fixes and modifications to support the new firmware.


*2020/09/28 - GUI v0.96beta
- While working on the next big update, I wanted to release a small update mainly to add direct support for the Sparkfun pro micro boards. So now no more empty sketch flashing needed!
- added the official Sparkfun drivers to the package, for those who are using Windows 7.
- added an icon to the GUI exe.
