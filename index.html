                    <b>I</b>t correspond to a program, receiving data from physical programmable circuit board, like Arduino or Teensy, where are connected sensors as inputs, for simulating outputs as a Virtual Xbox Controller or a Virtual Keyboard and Mouse. No input lag, no delay, no stick drift, no gyro drift, no stuttering, fine aiming, adpated and custom control, competitive and enjoyable. You aiming or driving with competitive-immerssive-intuitive-natural-emotional controls with motion abilities, as well as a pro player. It's possible to associate any controller with motion sensors, like a accelerometer and a magnetometer (to replace IR cam and sensor bar), in order to task as a custom Wiimote. Let's see...

                <p>
                    <b>T</b>he program is made for being more competitive than usual, but it ask a lot of experiences, and to want aiming or driving like in virtual reality games. The simple way is to connect sensors to Arduino or Teensy, and receive data in a program to simulate a virtual Xbox controller or virtual keyboard and mouse. Then with a 3D printer, build an armor for a controller or two armors for a splitted controller. I have programed with Teensy, Arduino, IR cam, Webcam, Microphone, Cronusmax, X-Aim, GIMX, Airmouse, Keyboard, Mouse, Wiimote, Joycons, Joycon Charging Grip, Pro controller, DualShock4, Dualsense, Xbox controller, PPJoy controller, Six Axis controller... for all games, on Linux, Windows and Xbox One. I have a lot of knowledge in controllers and motion controls, and so I can say that console isn't adapted to play games with motion controllers, because less than 10% of console games are playable with. PC is the ultimate platform to play games with motion controllers and to create one, because more than 90% of PC games are playable with. There are nice tutorials, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bigbigwon.com/product/controller/rainbow/tutorial/">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qUvamu9DLA">here</a> on Six Axis controllers to start easy playing with motion controls without annoying setting it up. You can find <a target="_blank" href="https://en.flydigi.com/index/down">here</a> the driver for Flydigi controllers. You can use August LP310 Remote Airmouse used normaly for Power Point presentation for Top Down Shooters or FPS combined with a controller. The native support of controllers in PC games, not native controllers known as keyboard/mouse and Xbox controller, is a very bad idea, because it result in low optimization of games and low or bugged or not running handle of controllers like with DirectInput controllers or Dualsense, also it's not in favor of some developpers who want practice on controller support, and it's a time consumer for game developpers. I imagined a standard way, I named StandardInGamingInputLowing, for using gaming controllers with motion abilities in all PC games. To note, for fully working, like using launch at PC boot option, you need to copy all external DLL in folder C:/Windows/System32/ with administrative privilege (keyboard.dll, mouse.dll, lhidread.dll, rhidread.dll, prohidread.dll, MotionInputPairing.dll, interception.dll). It need to combine it with PGM (ProGamingMapper) for having data of controllers, otherwise it would not be fully optimized, but it run like PGM, you just have to choose the type of script and synchronize Wiimote and Joycons at script run to connect it. It's not very different from PGM, only data view cannot be handle, it would ask a classic interface for it, not a scripting interface. My source codes and program are <a href="https://github.com/michaelandrefraniatte/AimController">here</a>.
